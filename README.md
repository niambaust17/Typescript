# Typescript

What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It is pure object-oriented with classes, interfaces and statically typed programming languages like C# or Java. You will need a compiler to compile and generate the code in the JavaScript file. Basically, TypeScript is the ES6 version of JavaScript with some additional features.

Features of TypeScript

Cross-Platform:  The TypeScript compiler can be installed on any Operating System such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
Object-Oriented Language: TypeScript provides features like Classes, Interfaces, and Modules. Thus, it can write object-oriented code for client-side as well as server-side development.
Static type-checking: TypeScript uses static typing and helps type checking at compile time. Thus, you can find errors while writing the code without running the script.
Optional Static Typing: TypeScript also allows optional static typing in case you are using the dynamic typing of JavaScript.
DOM Manipulation: You can use TypeScript to manipulate the DOM for adding or removing elements.
ES 6 Features: TypeScript includes most features of planned ECMAScript 2015 (ES 6, 7) such as class, interface, Arrow functions, etc.

Benefits of Using TypeScript

TypeScript is fast, simple, easy to learn and runs on any browser or JavaScript engine.
It is similar to JavaScript and uses the same syntax and semantics.
This helps backend developers write front-end code faster.
You can call the TypeScript code from an existing JavaScript code. Also, it works with existing JavaScript frameworks and libraries without any issues.

TS VS JS

TypeScript is an Object-Oriented language
It has a feature known as Static typing
TypeScript gives support for modules
It supports optional parameter function
 
JavaScript is a Scripting language
It does not have static typing
JavaScript does not support modules
It does not support optional parameter function

Run TS File:

Install Both
npm install -g ts-node
npm install -g typescript
Run
ts-node file_name.ts

Create tsconfig.json
tsc --init

If multiple .ts
tsc
